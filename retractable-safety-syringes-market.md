<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Retractable Safety Syringes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Manual Retractable Safety Syringe</li><li>Auto-retarctable Safety Syringe</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The retractable safety syringes market is segmented into two main types: manual retractable safety syringes and auto-retractable safety syringes. Manual retractable safety syringes require the user to physically retract the needle after use, enhancing safety by reducing the risk of needlestick injuries. In contrast, auto-retractable safety syringes feature a mechanism that automatically retracts the needle immediately after the injection is complete, providing an added layer of protection and convenience. Both types are designed to improve safety for healthcare workers and patients.</p></p>
