<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Oncology Ablation Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radiofrequency Ablation (RFA)</li><li>Microwave Ablation (MWA)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Oncology ablation encompasses techniques to destroy tumor cells and is primarily represented by Radiofrequency Ablation (RFA) and Microwave Ablation (MWA). RFA uses controlled radiofrequency energy to generate heat, effectively targeting and eliminating cancerous tissues, typically in liver or kidney tumors. Conversely, MWA employs microwaves to produce higher temperatures, allowing for rapid and extensive ablation of larger tumors. Both methods are minimally invasive alternatives to traditional surgery, offering reduced recovery times and improved patient outcomes in cancer treatment.</p></p>
